# FS2 Tutorial

## What

This is a self-guided tutorial to [FS2][fs2], using streaming data analytics for the majority of examples.
It's a combination of text and coding exercises.

The number one non-goal of this tutorial is to write a lot of material that already exists elsewhere. We'll refer to the following two documents for a lot of details.

* [FS2 Guide](https://fs2.io/#/guide)
* [FS2 API](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/co.fs2/fs2-core_3/latest/index.html)


## How

You should clone [this repository][repository] to your computer. In code/src/main/scala/ there are various code challenges you will work with. The text will tell you when to tackle each challenge.
